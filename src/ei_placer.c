/**
 * \brief	Configures the geometry of a widget using the "placer" geometry manager.
 * 		If the widget was already managed by another geometry manager, then it is first
 *		removed from the previous geometry manager.
 * 		If the widget was already managed by the "placer", then this calls simply updates
 *		the placer parameters: arguments that are not NULL replace previous values.
 * 		When the arguments are passed as NULL, the placer uses default values (detailed in
 *		the argument descriptions below). If no size is provided (either absolute or
 *		relative), then the requested size of the widget is used, i.e. the minimal size
 *		required to display its content.
 *
 * @param	widget		The widget to place.
 * @param	anchor		How to anchor the widget to the position defined by the placer
 *				(defaults to ei_anc_northwest).
 * @param	x		The absolute x position of the widget (defaults to 0).
 * @param	y		The absolute y position of the widget (defaults to 0).
 * @param	width		The absolute width for the widget (defaults to the requested width
 *				of the widget if rel_width is NULL, or 0 otherwise).
 * @param	height		The absolute height for the widget (defaults to the requested height
 *				of the widget if rel_height is NULL, or 0 otherwise).
 * @param	rel_x		The relative x position of the widget: 0.0 corresponds to the left
 *				side of the master, 1.0 to the right side (defaults to 0.0).
 * @param	rel_y		The relative y position of the widget: 0.0 corresponds to the top
 *				side of the master, 1.0 to the bottom side (defaults to 0.0).
 * @param	rel_width	The relative width of the widget: 0.0 corresponds to a width of 0,
 *				1.0 to the width of the master (defaults to 0.0).
 * @param	rel_height	The relative height of the widget: 0.0 corresponds to a height of 0,
 *				1.0 to the height of the master (defaults to 0.0).
